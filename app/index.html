<h1>Family Resource Contract</h1>
<h2>The first smart family contract</h2>
<h3>In each week, the kids will collect marbles for practicing their instrument (blue) or learning vocabulary (red).
    When by the end of a week they collect 2 red and 2 blue marbles, they get access to the internet on Tuesday and 
    Friday of the next week. Missed marbles have to be caught up with. If the kids practice more than 2 times a week 
    in each discipline they get neon colored marbles. When 10 neon marbles have been collected they can be redeemed 
    for a very special family event (like visiting a theme park, …)</h3>
